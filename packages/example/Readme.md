# Simply Served Example

This package is an example/starting point for a **Simply Served** node server.

From the repository root, run the following commands to start the server:

```bash
npm install
npm run start --workspace=packages/example
```

You will see that the server is running.

Open the file `packages/example/frontend/todo.html` (a simple todo web-page) in your browser. This page communicates with the server over HTTP to display and change data.
