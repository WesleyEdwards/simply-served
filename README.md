## Overview

**Simply Served** is a lightweight Node.js server framework designed to simplify server development while maintaining flexibility and extensibility.

The framework focuses on enabling developers to:

- Access and manipulate data effortlessly.
- Enforce permissions and maintain data integrity.
- Auto-generate REST endpoints with basic CRUD operations based on models and permissions.

Whether you're building a simple application or a complex API, Simply Served provides the tools you need to speed up development.

---

## Key Features

- **Auto-generated Endpoints**: Define your models and permissions, and let the framework handle the REST endpoints.
- **Database-agnostic**: Use any database by implementing a simple, abstracted interface.
- **Built-in Validation**: Ensure data integrity with Zod, a powerful and extensible schema validation library.
- **Express.js Backbone**: Leverage the flexibility and performance of Express.js under the hood.

## Example

Get started with an example server:  
[ðŸ‘‰ Example Server on GitHub](https://github.com/WesleyEdwards/simply-served/tree/main/example/src)

```typescript
// Basic usage of Simply Served
import {SimplyServer} from "simply-served"
import {z} from "zod"
import express from "express"

const server = createSimplyServer({
  initContext: {
    db: myDatabase,
  },
  controllers: {
    user: modelRestEndpoints({
      // Database access
      collection: (db) => db.user,
      // Schema validation
      validator: z.object({
        _id: z.string().uuid(),
        name: z.string(),
      }),
      // permissions defining who can do what
      permissions: {
        create: {type: "publicAccess"},
        read: {type: "publicAccess"},
        modify: {
          type: "modelAuth",
          check: ({myUserId}) => ({_id: {Equal: myUserId}}),
        },
        delete: {type: "notAllowed"},
      },
    }),
  },
})

server.generateEndpoints(express())
```
